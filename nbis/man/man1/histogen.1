.SH NAME
histogen \- Parses the text file of an ANSI/NIST 2007 file that is generated by an2k2txt and builds a histogram of Field Numbers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B histogen
.R [ options ] <TEMP DIR PATH> <FILES DIR PATH/filemask>

.SH DESCRIPTION
Histogen processes one or more ANSI/NIST 2007 files and builds a histogram of the number of times each field and sub-field appears within that set of ANSI/NIST files.  For examples of the various field types, see document NIST Special Publication 500-271 ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2007.
Also, histogen depends on the an2k2txt executable as a prerequisite.  Please ensure that an2k2txt is in your environment PATH.

The generated histogram text file, histogen.log, is saved into the
<FILES DIR PATH> dir.  <FILES DIR PATH> must be absolute.

<TEMP DIR PATH> is a directory where each ANSI/NIST file is copied
to be processed.  All files are deleted after processing such that
this dir is empty upon completion.  <TEMP DIR PATH> must be absolute.



.SH OPTIONS

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fB % histogen -i /d/tmp1 /d/ansi_nist/001/*
\fRGenerate histogram of all files in the 001 directory.  Include all invalid files: files with non-ANSI/NIST extension and files that cannot be processed by an2k2txt.
.TP
\fB % histogen -fnp /d/tmp1 /d/ansi_nist/001/a001_??.an2
\fRGenerate histogram of all files in the 001 directory per the ?? mask.  Include all Field Numbers that have missing or invalid data.
.TP
\fB % histogen /d/tmp1 /d/ansi_nist/001/*.sub
