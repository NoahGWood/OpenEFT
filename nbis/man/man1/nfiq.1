.SH NAME
nfiq \- evaluates a fingerprint image and returns a quality value for
the image on a scale of 1 (highest quality) to 5 (lowest quality).
When multiple fingerprint images are selected from an ANSI/NIST file,
the record number and fgp number are printed before the quality value.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Nfiq
takes as input a file containing a fingerprint image. The image file can
be in ANSI/NIST, NIST IHEAD, or raw format or compressed with WSQ, baseline 
JPEG, or lossless JPEG compression. \fBNfiq\fR uses the image maps generated by
\fBmindtct\fR to create a feature vector for the image which is passed to
an multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network.  The MLP NN returns an
activation value that is used to rank the images quality on a scale of
1 (highest quality) to 5 (lowest quality).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-d \fIdefault\fR
Prints the image quality value (1-5) to standard output.  This is also the default if neither \fB-d\fR nor \fB-v\fR are specified.  When multiple images are present in an ANSI/NIST file, the record number and FGP are printed out before the image quality value.
.TP
\fB-v \fIverbose\fR
Prints all the feature vectors, image quality value (1-5) and neural
network activiation values (0.0-1.0) to standard output.
.TP
\fB-o \fIOld behavior\fR
Calculate and print values for only the first grayscale fingerprint
record in an ANSI/NIST file.
.TP
\fB-raw \fIraw image\fR
Calculate the NFIQ score from a raw image file.
.TP
Record Selection Options
The folowing options are used to select particular records from an
ANSI/NIST file that match the specified characteristics.  Multiple
specifications for one option are treated as alternatives (logical OR).
Multiple different types of selectors are all required to be true of a
particular record in order for it to be selected (logical AND).  See
.BR record_selector (1F)
for details.
\fB-raw \fIattributes\fR
Specifies that \fIfing-image-in\fR is a raw image file and its attributes are width,height,depth[,ppi].  PPI is assumed to be 500 if omitted.
.P
\fB-f \fIfinger position (FGP), and optional impression type (IMP)\fR
.br
\fB-i \fIimpression type (IMP)\fR
.br
\fB-n \fIimage designation character (IDC) \fR(actually a number from 0 to 255)
.br
\fB-t \fIlogical record type (LRT)\fR
.br
\fB-q \fINIST fingerprint image quality metric (NQM)\fR
.br
\fB-r \fIread selectors from a file\fR
.br
\fB-w \fIwrite selectors to a file\fR
.TP
.I fing-image-in
A file containing the input fingerprint image(s) to be evaluated.
.TP
.I ANSI/NIST-out
When the input is an ANSI/NIST file and an output file name is
specified, the fingerprint quality results will be written into NQM
fields in the appropriate records in the output file.  Type-4
fingerprint records, except for latent impressions, will be converted
to Type-14 in order to allow the addition of an NQM field.  Any NQM
fields already present will be overwritten with the new results.
.TP
\fB-version
\fRPrint ANSI/NIST stardand and NBIS software version.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B % nfiq ../../data/a011_02_02.wsq
.br
prints the image quality value (1-5) to standard output.

.B % nfiq -v ../../data/a011_02_02.wsq
.br
prints all the feature vectors, image quality value (1-5) and neural
network activiation values (0.0-1.0) to standard output.

.B % nfiq ../../data/a001.an2 a001-nfq.an2
copies the input file to a001-nf1.an2, adding NQM values where
appropriate, and converting Type-4 records to Type-14 as required to
allow for addition of the NQM field.

.B % nfiq -fi:r ../../data/a001.an2
prints the record number, finger number, and image quality value for
all rolled index finger records to standard output.

.B % nfiq -raw 320,528,8 ../../data/a011_02.raw
.br
prints the image quality value (1-5) for a raw image file with the specified 
attributes to standard output
