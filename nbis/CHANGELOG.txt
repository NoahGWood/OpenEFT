                                 Change History
                   ----------------------------------------------

03/04/2015  NBIS: Rel 5.0.0
            - Updated OpenJPEG library support from version 1.4 to 2.1.
            - The official NIST JPEG2000 Reference CODEC (based on
              OpenJPEG 2.1) has been included in this release for the first
              time, and replaces the previously generic CJP2K encoder and
              DJP2K decoder.
            - Replaced non-POSIX strdup() with POSIX malloc() and POSIX
              strncpy() to prevent pointer conversion error.
            - New installation instructions for CYGWIN.
            - Updated installation instructions for LINUX, MAC OSX and
              Windows operating systems.
            - Various minor enhancements and bug fixes.

10/30/2013  NBIS: Rel 4.2.0
            - Fixed compile issues with MAC OSX 10.8.X. Forced OpenJPEG only
              uses LMCS-1.
            - Fixed 32bit OpenJPEG build issue on a 64bit LINUX environment 
              when --m32 option is set. 
            - Remove return statements from void-returning functions in 
              xytrepsc.c, whose presence raises an error in newer compilers.
            - Add -l compile option to link with X11 for PCASYS application.
            - Add missing X11 include for libpca build.  
            - Enhancements and bug fixes for MSYS installation.

05/21/2012  NBIS: Rel 4.1.0
            - New installation instruction for LINUX, MAC OSX and Windows
              operating system.
            - Remove operating system architecture check from setup.sh.
            - Default build with -fPIC compiling option.
            - Fixed OpenJPEG build issue relate to -m32 and -m64 compiling
              operation.
            - Bug fix on libnbis.a creation.
            - JASPER library support is deprecated.
            - Add --without-OPENJPEG option to disable OpenJPEG image 
              format support.
            - Add two new functions (lfs2nist_format and bz_prune) to support 
              in-memory write/read on minutiae detection to XYT structure.

10/16/2011  NBIS: Rel 4.0.1
            - Correct a flaw introduced in Rel 4.0.0 where a binary object
              larger than four bytes fails to be read from an AN2K record.

09/15/2011
            NBIS: Rel 4.0.0
            - Updated OpenJPEG library support from version 1.3 to 1.4.
            - Added support for scanning an AN2K record from a memory buffer. 
              This change adds a few functions that are substitutes for
              fread(3), ftell(3), and fgetc(3) in order to read/scan from a 
              file or buffer, making the change to the existing read routines 
              simpler.
            - New option is implemented for "make install LIBNBIS=[yes|no]". 
              If you enable the "LIBNBIS=no" option during make install, it 
              will create the following libraries: 
                   liban2k.a libclapck.a libfft.a libioutil.a libmindtct.a
                  libnfseg.a libpcautil.a libutil.a libbozorth3.a libf2c.a 
                  libihead.a libjpegb.a libmlp.a libopenjpeg.a libpcax.a 
                  libwsq.a libcblas.a libfet.a libimage.a libjpegl.a 
                  libnfiq.a libpca.a libpng.a libz.a
              If you enable the "LIBNBIS=yes" option during make install, the 
              build process will combine all the libraries listed above and 
              build a libnbis.a.
            - Included in this release of NBIS is the NIST point cloud 
              visualization bundle which is designed to allow users to
              visualize fingerprint images using either 3D point cloud data
              or convert legacy 2D RAW fingerprint images (*.RAW) into a 2.5D 
              simulated 3D images within the viewer.
              The NIST point cloud visualization bundle contains two 
              applications:
                  1) MeshLab (NIST modified version) - is a point cloud 
                          visualization tool that reads an input file with 
                          NIST-specific point cloud format and provides the 
                          user with point cloud editing, filtering and
                          rendering capabilities.
                  2) Point Cloud Creator - this application allows the user to 
                          convert a RAW fingerprint image to the NIST-specific 
                          point cloud file format.
             - The SIVV library and utility application have been updated with 
               improvements to memory management, speed, and efficiency. SIVV 
               now uses less memory when processing images and is capable of 
               processing those images more quickly than in previous versions. 
               Additionally, the segmentation/centering feature has been improved 
               and now provides more accurate results. Finally, two new 
               command-line switches have been added which allow the user to 
               specify which windowing function to be used by the algorithm as 
               well as suppress console (screen) output.
             - Included in this release of NBIS is the source code for the final 
               release C++ version of ANSI-NIST ITL Part 1 and Part 2 (XML) data
               conversion tool. Improvement from last version include:
                  - Added and improved API
                  - Added new namespace for EBTS and DOJ.
                  - Improved validation for subfield and item elements
                  - Enhanced regular-expressions for string comparison
                  - Added new function to validate min and max of item value
                  - Added new type 1 and type 2 fields for validation
               See README file under <FINAL INSTALLATION DIR>/misc/an2kconvert 
               directory for installation, usage, and examples.
             - Big-endian compilation is no longer being tested and support as 
               an official release. Warning: This version of NBIS may compile on 
               a big-endian machine; however, undesired behavior may occur. Use 
               NBIS at your own risk. 

10/13/2010
            NBIS: Rel 3.3.1
            - Separated the README file to INSTALL and CHANGELOG.
            - Updated the setup instruction.
            - The openjpeg implementation is still under evaluation.  While the
              cjp2k and djp2k applications are included, the default parameters
              switches for lossy and lossless compression, as listed under notes
              for Rel 3.3.0, are not available.
            - Fix to WSQ compression algorithm variance computation that fixes 
              a problem with images captured near the edge of larger platen 
              capture devices. The compression of these images could cause 
              severe degradation or complete loss of the original image. To 
              date this was mostly noticed in the two thumb captures in 
              Identification Flats.
            - Please use Test_3.3.0 test branch to test against this NBIS release.

09/15/2010
            NBIS: Rel 3.3.0
            - NBIS now builds by default using OpenJPEG libraries for JPEG2000
              standard implementation.  To build instead with Jasper libraries,
              use appropriate setup.sh switch.  Note: must run 'make clean'
              between builds using --with-OPENJPEG and --with-JASPER; otherwise
              jpeg2000 libraries will not be updated and build will fail.
            - Codecs for OpenJPEG compression/decompression have file names
              cjp2k/djp2k.  cjp2k has been modified to include switches that
              define default parameters for lossy and lossless compression
              of 1000 ppi fingerprint images.  See man pages for details.
              Also, OpenJPEG codecs require LibTIFF library to build and run.
              For Windows platforms, download the LibTIFF source, build, and
              then copy libtiff.a to the <FINAL INSTALLATION DIR>\openjpeg\src
              \lib\openjpeg\libs\libtiff directory.
            - Jasper implementations for Jpeg 2000 standard are now included
              as part of this suite: jp2codec (for compression and decompression),
              imgcmp, and imginfo.  These apps are built when the --with-JASPER
              switch is used for setup.sh.
            - A new application has been included in this release of NBIS, histogen.
              This application processes one or more ANSI/NIST 2007 files and builds
              a histogram of the number of times each field and sub-field appears
              within that set of ANSI/NIST files.
              For examples of the various field types, see document NIST Special
              Publication 500-271 ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2007.
              Histogen depends on the an2k2txt executable as a prerequisite.
              Please ensure that an2k2txt is in your environment PATH.
            - For all Windows platforms, must upgrade to latest version of
              MinGW/GCC.  To install manually on 32-bit platform, unzip the
              following archives into <ROOT_DRIVE>:/mingw.  Note that g++ compiler
              is required to build LibTIFF library under Windows.
                gcc-core 4.5.0
                gcc-c++  4.5.0
                binutils 2.20.1
                libmpc   0.8.1
                libmpfr  2.4.1
                libgmp   5.0.1
                mingwrt  3.18  (dev)
                win32api 3.14  (dev)

              To install MinGW/GCC on 64-bit Windows, see instructions above.
            - Included in this release of NBIS is the source code for the Beta-4
              (Candidate final) C++ version of ANSI-NIST ITL Part 1 and Part 2 (XML)
              data conversion tool. See README file under <FINAL INSTALLATION DIR>/
              misc/an2kconvert directory for installation, usage, and examples.

02/01/2010
            NBIS: Rel 3.2.0
            - NBIS suite is now available for Windows.  In order to build
              and run on Windows platform, must install MinGW, MSYS, and upgrade
              to gcc version 4.4.x.  These tools are free and available for
              download. Support includes WinXP Pro, Windows 7, both 32- and
              64-bit platforms.
            - The Spectral Image Validation/Verification (SIVV) Metric for
              Fingerprints application has been added to this NBIS suite.
              It requires a separate build process and other dependencies in
              order to build and run.  See the accompanying README under the
              SIVV directory.
            - Added new app under an2k named chkan2k.  See man page for usage
              and description. *Warning* This application is in late beta
              stages and still undergoing changes and testing.
            - CropCoeff app: wsq_crop_qdata() finds and copies the coefficients
              that need to be retained for the crop.  Instead of blindly
              stepping through all the coefficients as was done in the old
              version, the new version jumps directly to the regions needed,
              and uses memcpy on just the chunks required.  Outside of the
              Huffman coding, this is the other main time sink for CropCoeff.
            - Added benchmarking to test scripts (*.sh).  A new shell script
              bench/exec_time.sh was added.  When test scripts run, the
              execution time(s) is entered into a log file, one for each test
              script.  There is also a "master" log file that is created and
              updated when master_test.sh is run.  Each files' content is 
              delimited by ; (semicolon) for easy import into a spreadsheet.
            - There are file dependencies generated and required by the test
              scripts.  For example, the optrws application as run from the
              optrws_test.sh script requires files created by the eva_evt and
              lintran applications.  Running master_test.sh handles these
              dependencies.
            - Master Test runtime tip for Linux: pcasysx will run indefinitely.
              You will know it's running by the images flashed on the display.
              In order for master_test.sh script to run to completion, kill the
              pcasysx process only.
            - Test scripts require the following environment variables to be
              set: FINAL_INSTALLATION_BIN_DIR and NBIS_TEST_DIR.  On Windows
              platform, environment variables may be set by either 1) Advanced
              tab of System Properties dialog or 2) export command in the
              <MSYS install dir>\etc\profile file.
            - Windows 64-bit applications are built without any compiler
              optimizations as this is not fully supported by GNU gcc on the
              Windows 64-bit platform.
            - MSYS does not (yet) support UNIX-style Manpages documentation
              format. Therefore, on Windows platform, you can either install
              the MSYS support (internet search "mingw FAQ man") or install
              Cygwin. For Cygwin, simply run the "man" command as described in
              the "User's Guide to NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS)" in a
              Cygwin window. 
            - *WARNING* While the following applications will build on
              64-bit platforms as part of the NBIS build process, they exhibit
              64-bit operational issues and should not be used until further
              notice:
                - eva_evt
                - fixwts
                - kltran
                - lintran
                - meancov
                - mkoas
           - Note: The "User's Guide to NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS)"
             under the doc/ directory is pending to update in the next release.

05/29/2009
            NBIS     : Rel 3.1.0
            - Integrated NFSEG and BOZORTH3 to NBIS.
              It has been determined that the export control restriction
              did not apply to the NFSEG and BOZORTH3 software, due to both
              being outside the scope of EAR(see Part 734.3 of the EAR for 
              exact details); they are freely distributed and considered 
              public domain.
            - Modified the NBIS to support 64 bit systems.
            - Modified the NFIQ application to support a raw image as input.
            - Modified the RDIMGWH application output format.
            - Made changes to better detect corrupt WSQ encoded images 
              during decoding.
            - Modified the build system to build on MSYS with MinGW on
              WIN32 machine.
            - Added setup option to allow user to specific to compile
              either 32bit or 64bit machine.
            - Added setup option to disable JASPER and PNG libraries 
              support
            - Added cjp2k and djp2k applications to encode and decode
              JPEG2000 image format. This is based on OPENJPEG library.

            - Note: The "User's Guide to NIST Biometric Image
                    Software (NBIS)" under the doc/ directory
                    is pending to update in the next release.

            - Warning: The CWSQ and DWSQ applications are only 
                       experimental on 64-bit OS. Use at your
                       own risk.

10/30/2008
            NBIS Non-Export Control    : Rel 3.0.0
            - Renamed an2k7 naming convention back to an2k for 
              compatibility issues.
            - Added code to the AN2K library to select specific
              records from ANSI/NIST files based on metadata
              included in the record, and to parse new command
              line options used to control those selections.
            - Corrected a subtle but serious typographic error in
              the copy_ANSI_NIST() function in the AN2K library.
            - Modified DPYAN2K to use the new record selection
              code in the AN2K library, so that it will display
              only the specified images.  Also added display of
              segmentation data if present in SEG or ASEG fields
              of Type-14 records.
            - Modified AN2K library to be able to insert complex
              structures, i.e., records, fields, subfields, into
              an AN2K structure from memory instead of only from
              a file.
            - Added support to AN2K library for 8-bit JP2 images,
              in addition to previously supported 24-bit images.
            - Added CORCOEFF application, which extracts the individual 
              fingerprint images from the WSQ compressed slap images
              (left/right hand, thumbs) in ANSI/NIST 2007 Type-14
              records into individual WSQ files without
              decompressing/recompressing the slap images.
            - Added the RDIMGWH application, which finds the image
              width and height within an image file or specified
              images in ANSI/NIST files, and displays them.
            - Modified NFIQ to use new AN2K library record
              selection options, to write results into the NQM
              field of Type-14 records, and to convert Type-4
              records to Type-14 when necessary in order to
              add the NQM field.
