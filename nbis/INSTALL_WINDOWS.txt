                    NBIS Open Source Software Installation Guide
                                   (For Windows)
                   ----------------------------------------------

Step 1:
        Install CMake and the MinGW/MSYS build environment.

        ** NOTE **
        NBIS may not build successfully if your MinGW/MSYS is not installed
        following the procedure described below in the "Installation Guide for 
        the MinGW/MSYS build environment" (at the end of this document). 
	
        Automated installers (as well as full source code) for Windows versions
        of CMake are available at http://www.cmake.org/download/.

        ** NOTE **
        You must add the cmake executable's location to your PATH variable
        (the installer can do this or it can be done manually post-installation).

Step 2:
        Run the following command to setup your build environment for MSYS/MinGW
        on WIN32 (or WIN64):

        ./setup.sh <TARGET INSTALLATION DIR> --MSYS [--STDLIBS] [--32 | --64]

        <TARGET INSTALLATION DIR> must be replaced by the specific directory path
        where you want to install the NBIS applications, libraries,
        pre-computed runtime data and manuals. The <TARGET INSTALLATION DIR> 
        must be an absolute path. 

        For both architectures, run setup.sh using <TARGET INSTALLATION DIR>
        with the format of <DRIVE LETTER> followed by : (colon).  
        (ex: C:/SRC/NBIS/Main)

        You must run setup.sh as described above.  If you do not, then
        there is no guarantee that all applications will build and/or run.

        Options Usage:
             --STDLIBS              Build without OPENJP2 and PNG image
                                    format support
             --32                   Build on 32-bit architecture machine.
             --64                   Build on 64-bit architecture machine.


        Example:
        > ./setup.sh C:/SRC/NBIS/Main --MSYS --32
 
Step 3:
        Run the following commands to build "NBIS":
        > make config
        > make it

Step 4:
        Run the following command to install NBIS executables into the
        <TARGET_INSTALLATION_DIR> directory:
        > make install

Step 5: (OPTIONAL)
        Run the following command, if you want to generate a list of
        API supported in NBIS.
        > make catalog

                   Installation Guide For MinGW/MSYS build environment                    
                             (For Windows 32- and 64-bit)
                -----------------------------------------------------

** NOTE ** 
If you have not already installed CMake, you should do so before installing MinGW/MSYS.
(Otherwise, you may have to restart the MSYS shell after installing CMake.)

Step 1:
        Download the following packages for MSYS and MinGW-get:
            - MSYS: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/MSYS-20111123.zip/download
            - MinGW-get: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get/mingw-get-0.5-beta-20120426-1/mingw-get-0.5-mingw32-beta-20120426-1-bin.zip/download


Step 2:
        Download the correct MinGW package for your platform (32- or 64-bit):
            - MinGW (32-bit): http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/megasoft78/basic/mingw-w64-bin_i686-mingw_4.5.2_20110223_megasoft78.7z/download
                 -- OR --
            - MinGW (64-bit): http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Multilib%20Toolchains%28Targetting%20Win32%20and%20Win64%29/megasoft78/mingw-w64-bin_x86_64-mingw_4.5.2_20110222_multilib_megasoft78.7z/download

NOTE: The 64-bit version of MinGW will allow you to build NBIS binaries in 
      both 32- and 64-bit versions, using the flags specified in the build
      instructions above. 

Step 3:
        Extract the MinGW package to a convenient directory (without spaces).
            Ex: C:\mingw64\ *OR* C:\mingw32\

Step 4:
        Extract the MSYS package to another, separate, directory (without spaces).
            Ex: C:\msys\

Step 5:
        Extract the MinGW-get package to the same directory as the the MinGW
        directory used in Step 2 above.
           Ex: C:\mingw64\ *OR* C:\mingw32\

Step 6: 
        Open an MSYS command prompt (run MSYS.bat from the directory where the 
        MSYS package was extracted) and run the post-install configuration script
        by typing the following command:
           > /postinstall/pi.sh

        Answer "yes" to all questions and provide the full path to the directory 
        where the MinGW package was extracted when prompted for the location 
        of MinGW.

Step 7:
        Run the following command to finalize the configuration of MSYS and MinGW:
           > mingw-get install mingw32-autotools

        (This step requires that your computer is connected to the internet and 
        may take several minutes depending on the speed of your connection.)
