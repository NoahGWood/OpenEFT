This directory contains six 3d models that can be used to test trimeshinfo. 
The models represent a toroidal knot at two different level of details:

- knot_orig.ply           12800 vertexes, 25600 triangles: the original high resolution mesh
- knot_subsampled.ply       800 vertexes,  1600 triangles: a low res model obtained by simple uniform subsampling
- knot_vcg_simplified.ply   800 vertexes,  1600 triangles: a low res model obtained by our library simplification code

a low resolution model of the Kleine bottle:

- kleine.ply		    255 vertexes, 520 triangles

two low resolution models of the moebius strip:

- moebius.ply		     80 vertexes, 160 triangles
- moebius_big.ply	    320 vertexes, 480 triangles
