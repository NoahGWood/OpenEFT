The NBIS software has been determined to be outside the scope of the EAR
(see Part 734.3 of the EAR for exact details) as it has been created solely
by employees of the U.S. Government; it is freely distributed with no
licensing requirements; and it is considered public domain.Â  Therefore,
it is permissible to distribute this software as a free download from the
internet.

The "User's Guide to Non-Export Controlled" and "User's Guide to Export 
Controlled" is pending to combine to one document in the future release.
